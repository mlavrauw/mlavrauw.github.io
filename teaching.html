<h2><code><a name="PG_Ghent">Projectieve Meetkunde</a> (Ghent University)</code></h2>

<p>General course for 2nd Bachelor in Mathematics at Ghent University.

<p>Position of the Course:
The students should apply their pre-knowledge on geometry from the courses Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry to the study of projective spaces. The way of setting up the course, will stimulate the student to be skilled in handling more abstract mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Contents:
Starting with the general definition of a projective space over fields (including homogeneous coordinates, the theorems of Desargues and of Pappus, collineations, correlations and perspectivities) a detailed study is given of projective lines over fields (isomorphisms between projective lines, cross ratio, the theorem of the complete 4-gon, involutions). After that a general study of polarities will be treated, including classification and standard forms; emphasizing the polarities in projective spaces over the reals, the complex numbers and a finite field. In the special case of polarities in projective planes over finite fields, the study of conics and hermitian curves will be treated, as well as generalizations such as ovals, hyperovals and unitals. There is also a treatise on some polar spaces of low rank. The last chapter of the course contains an axiomatic study of projective and affine planes; the coordinatisation method; the relation with ternary rings; as well as some simple non-Desarguesian planes will be discussed.

<h2><code><a name="gentlessen">Finite semifields and related structures in finite geometry</a> (Ghent University)</code></h2>
These <a href="gentlessen.pdf">notes</a> consist of material for approximately four hours, depending on the level of the students.
<p>
The first part is aimed at understanding the connection between translation planes and spreads; the so-called Andr{\'e}-Bruck-Bose construction. Next we define the notion of semifields (first studied by L. E. Dickson (1906)) and use a vector space representation to obtain semifield spreads, after which we can apply the Andr{\'e}-Bruck-Bose construction to obtain semifield planes. We define the notion of isotopy and mention the important result proved by A. A. Albert
 in 1960, which says that two semifields are isotopic if and only if the corresponding planes are isomorphic. All of this belongs to, let's say, the "classical" part of the notes. It gives us the necessary background to be able to deal with some more recent topics in Finite Geometry which have received quite a lot of attention during the last two decades.
We start this "modern" part with a particular configuration of subspaces which turns out to be equivalent to semifields, i.e., each such configuration can be used to construct a semifield and vice versa, each semifield gives rise to such a configuration. We conclude these notes with an example of a well-studied structure in finite geometry related to semifields, namely translation ovoids (sometimes called semifield ovoids) of the parabolic quadric in 4-dimensional
projective space. We show their correspondence with semifields by constructing them from a particular case of the configuration of subspaces mentioned above.

<h2><code><a name="CC">Coding Theory and Cryptography</a>
  (University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand)</code></h2>

<p>
I gave part of this course during my visit to the
University of Canterbury as an Erskine Fellow. The other part was
given by Geertrui Van de Voorde. The course deals with the mathematical ideas underlying modern
cryptography, including algebra, number theory and probability
theory. The course covers basic coding theory, including Hamming codes, weight
enumerators, sphere-packing bound, Singleton bound, MacWilliams
identities, parity check matrix, dual codes, mutually orthogonal latin
squares, decoding algorithms. The second part is an
introduction to cryptography, starting with the discrete log problem.
