<b>About research assessment</b><br/>
Most scientists will agree that the academic world is suffering from research assessment methods which are based too much on quantity instead of quality; methods which are usually imposed upon the evaluating committees by the administration of research funding agencies and universities. Funding agencies, policy makers, academic institutions, and researchers themselves, are encouraged to reflect on better ways to evaluate scientific research. Creating awareness is one of the steps towards progress in this matter, and many universities and research organisations have already signed the <a href="https://sfdora.org">San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment</a> (DORA). Here is one of the 18 recommendations from DORA: <i>"When involved in committees making decisions about funding, hiring, tenure, or promotion, make assessments based on scientific content rather than publication metrics."</i> If anything, let this be an encouragement to scientists to urge the policy makers at governments and academic institutions to reflect on this matter, and take action to improve the flawed research assessment methods.
