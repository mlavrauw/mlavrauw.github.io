   Below you can find the slides, gapcode, and exercise sheets of a minicourse I gave at 
   the <a href="https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2025-spring/">GAP Days Spring 2025</a> at the VUB in Brussels. 
   More details of the GAP days can be found on the website of the workshop. The minicourses consisted of lectures 
   and exercise sessions. There were two further minicourses during the gapdays: one by 
   <a href="https://www.ilariacolazzo.info">Ilaria Colazzo</a> 
   including an introduction to GAP and focussing on Group Theory in GAP (permutation groups and matrix groups), 
   and one by 
   <a href="http://www.iaa.tu-bs.de/beick/">Bettina Eick</a> on finite p-groups and solvable
   groups in GAP, on the GAP packages SmallGroups and GrpConst, and on the Lazard correspondence and Lie p-rings 
   in GAP (LiePRing package). The minicourse I gave, included an introduction to the GAP packages FinInG (Finite 
   Incidence Geometry) and GUAVA (Coding Theory), as well as some more advanced features of these GAP packages.
